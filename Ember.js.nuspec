    <description>Ember.js is built for productivity. Designed with developer ergonomics in mind, its friendly APIs help you get your job doneâ€”fast.
      Don't waste time making trivial choices. Ember.js incorporates common idioms so you can focus on what makes your app special, not reinventing the wheel.</description>
    <summary>A framework for creating ambitious web applications.</summary>
